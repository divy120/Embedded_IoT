Subject: Request for Permission to conduct written test for drone club recrutement

Dear sir,

I am writing to formally request your permission to conduct a written test as part of the recruitment process for the Drone Club at Akgec.

As you may be aware, the Drone Club at Akgec plays a pivotal role in fostering student interest and expertise in the field of drone technology and aerial robotics. Our club is dedicated to providing a platform for students to develop their skills and knowledge in this exciting field, and we are keen to attract passionate and capable individuals who share our enthusiasm.

To identify individuals who are not only enthusiastic but also possess a strong foundation in drone technology, we have planned to administer a written test as part of our recruitment process. This written test will evaluate candidates' knowledge of drone technology, principles of flight, safety protocols, and related topics. We believe that this test will help us select the most qualified and dedicated members for our club.

Here are the details of the proposed written test:

Date: 10-9-2023
Time: 4:00PM-6:00PM
Location:PLM lab
Duration: 2hrs
Format: The written test will consist of 18 multiple-choice questions and 2 short-answer questions related to drone technology.

We want to assure you that the test will be conducted with the highest level of integrity and in strict adherence to all college guidelines and regulations. We will take full responsibility for ensuring a fair and secure testing environment and preventing any form of academic misconduct.

I kindly request your permission to use PLM Lab for the written test and any support or resources that may be required for its successful administration. We believe that this test will not only help us select outstanding members for our club but also contribute to the overall academic and extracurricular experience of students at Akgec.

Your support for this initiative is highly valued, and we are committed to conducting the test with the utmost professionalism and transparency. If you have any questions or require additional information, please do not hesitate to contact me at [Your Email Address] or [Your Phone Number].

Thank you for considering our request. We eagerly await your positive response and the opportunity to conduct this written test as part of our recruitment process.

Sincerely,

Alshwarys Laxmi
