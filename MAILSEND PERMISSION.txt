Dear Sir,

I am writing to seek your permission to send official communication via email to the 1st and 2nd year students regarding an upcoming recruitment drive for the Drone Club at Akgec.

The Drone Club has been an active and valuable part of our college community, providing students with opportunities to explore and excel in the field of drone technology and aerial robotics. In our continuous efforts to promote this exciting field and expand our club's membership, we plan to conduct a recruitment drive for interested junior students.

To ensure that all eligible students are informed about this opportunity, we would like to send an official email notification to the junior class through their college email addresses. This notification will contain information about the recruitment drive, its date, time, and location, as well as details about how students can apply and participate.

We kindly request your authorization to proceed with this email communication to our 1st and 2nd year students. 

Thank you for your consideration of our request. We look forward to your positive response and the opportunity to engage our junior students in this exciting recruitment drive.

Sincerely,

Aishwarys Laxmi
Head of drone club
